# odin-recipes
This is a small demonstration of using html5 to display a website containing recipes.
The above website was a part of the project instructed to me by theodinproject.
I used the basics of html which I was taught.
There may be further changes in the website when I acquire more knowledge.
Anyways, do try one of those recipes and let me know!
